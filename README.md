# meitnerium-intellij

Meitnerium theme for JetBrains IDEs.

This theme uses a modified version of the Dracula theme
[plugins.jetbrains.com](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12275-dracula-theme)
[github.com](https://github.com/dracula/jetbrains).

## Supported IDEs

I have only tested and used this theme on the new UI and the following JetBrains IDEs

- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
- GoLand 
- PyCharm Professional


## Installation

This theme is currently not on the JetBrains plugin marketplace, and i dont think i will bother to upload it there.

To install the theme follow these steps:

1. Download the last `.jar` release from here (https://github.com/c-jaenicke/meitnerium-intellij/releases/tag/wow)
2. Open your IDE settings
3. Go to `Plugins`
4. Click on the small cog next to the searchbar, and choose `Install from Disk`
5. Navigate to the `.jar` you downloaded, and open it
6. Possibly restart your IDE
7. Choose the theme under `Appearence`

## TODO

Currently, there is no editor scheme, only a theme for the UI itself.
